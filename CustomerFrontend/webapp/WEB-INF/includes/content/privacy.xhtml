			<p><b>1. Scope</b></p>
			
			<p>This Privacy Notice applies 
			to easyTravel Web sites. Our strategy regarding privacy 
			and personal information is to protect the personally identifiable information 
			(PII) of its customers, business partners, and employees that is in 
			its possession at any given time within its organization. This protection 
			also applies to any PII collected, used or retained by easyTravel in 
			its dealings with third parties. <br/></p>
			
			<p>easyTravel has the responsibility 
			to ensure compliance with applicable privacy legislation when identifying 
			purposes, obtaining consent, providing notice, or responding to access 
			requests or complaints regarding the collection, use, or disclosure 
			of personal information.</p>
			<p>easyTravel will act responsibly 
			while collecting, using, and disclosing personal information, as this 
			is a prerequisite to continued customer, partner, and employee confidence 
			and loyalty. <br/></p>
			<p>In accordance with the 
			Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) derived from the Fair Information 
			Practices of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development 
			(OECD), easyTravel will demonstrate compliance with its privacy policies 
			through the creation and enforcement of such policies and other supporting 
			documentation. <br/></p>

			Use of Personal Information</b></p>

			personal information through our web sites. Here are the ways in which

			service and technical support, or otherwise utilize products or services 
			that you have selected, as well as technical data concerning your computer

			</p>
			<p>Additionally, you may 
			be asked in cases where software is sold pursuant to subscription, to 
			establish an account with us in order to obtain the software, and establish 
			entitlement to upgrades and updates required for the easyTravel software 
			to provide ongoing protection in accordance with its function. </p>
			<p>This information will

			extension/delivering product updates/service-subscriptions or licenses, 
			product registration and activation, customer and technical support 
			as you may request it from time to time, processing license renewals

			renewals if you elect automatic renewal of your software license subscription 
			and internal (compliance) audits and fraud prevention.</p>
			<p><b><i>2.4 Technical Support</i></b></p>
			<p>If you request technical 
			support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete 
			the transaction - such as your name, address and information about 
			your computer hardware, software and the nature of the problem you are 
			experiencing. Additionally, if required to facilitate support, we may 
			with your permission conduct an interactive session in which a easyTravel 
			technical support assumes control of your computer. </p>
			<p>No information is retained 
			from such sessions beyond information to substantiate that such session(s) 
			took place. Information concerning technical issues may be retained 
			to provide you with continuing support; generally, the information and 
			knowledge obtained from such support, though not linked to you personally, 
			may be made available to technical and product specialists in order 
			to improve our products or provide similar solutions to similar technical 
			issues encountered by other easyTravel customers.  <br/>

			web sites and related information services to better assist its customers

			services, to assist us in creating content that is relevant to you, 
			and to improve your experience on our Web site, including helping you

			<p><b><i>2.7 Transactional 
			Emails</i></b></p>

			<p>In jurisdictions where 
			your consent is required at the point of collection before any sharing 
			of your information can take place, you will be given the option to 
			opt-in before such information is being shared, and to opt-in to the 
			transfer of your contact information to a third party.</p>
			
			<p>In other jurisdictions, 
			we may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information,

			<p><b><i>3.2 Other Privacy 
			Considerations</i></b></p>
			<p>Please remember that 
			information you submit in a discussion groups or forums will be deemed

			<p><b><i>3.3 Update or Correction 
			of Personal Information</i></b></p>
			<p>We make our best effort 
			to respond to your requests to update or correct your personal information. 
			If you believe that easyTravel does not have your most current personal 
			information, you can use one of the other communication channels at 
			the bottom of this notice. If requested, and to the extent permissible 
			by applicable law relating to the retention of records or otherwise 
			not required for valid business purposes (such as fulfillment of transactions), 
			you may request that we use our best efforts to remove such data from 
			easyTravel repositories. <br/></p>
			<p><b>4. Transfer and 
			Sharing of Information</b></p>
			<p><b><i>4.1 Transfer of 
			Information</i></b></p>
			<p>Since easyTravel is a 
			global company, we provide company information to our worldwide offices, 
			with information processing taking place in many countries. The personal 
			information that you have provided to us, for the purposes set out above, 
			will be transferred to servers in the United States, and there may be 
			further transfers to other countries in which easyTravel has operations 
			or to our outside contractors for the collection, transferring, storage 
			and processing of your information. Your consent is required for the 
			provision of the products and services set out above as well as for 
			the collection and transfer of your personal information for the purposes 
			identified above. <br/></p>
			<p>When you submit your 
			information via our web sites, you expressly consent to the collection 
			and transfer of your personal information for the purpose identified 
			above, and you understand, if you reside outside the United States, 
			that this information may be transferred to other companies of the easyTravel 
			group in the United States or to other countries that may have less 
			protective data protection standards than the region in which you are 
			situated (including the European Union), in which case easyTravel will 
			have taken steps to ensure that the collected information, if transferred, 
			receives an adequate level of protection. <br/></p>
			
			<p><b><i>4.2 Sharing of 
			Information</i></b></p>
			<p>From time to time, and 
			in jurisdictions where it is permitted, we may provide your information 
			to easyTravel Partners to communicate to you information or offers 
			about products or services that they believe are important to you or 
			your business. If you prefer that we not provide your information to 
			our business partners, you may let us know using one of the methods 
			described in this policy, easyTravel provides a number of ways for you 
			to "opt-out" of receiving additional information from us or 
			having us provide your personal information to our partners by "opt-out" 
			options provided at the point of collection, through e-mail notices, 
			or through other preference management that may be available depending 
			on the service or web-site.</p>
			<p>If you do not wish to 
			continue receiving our e-mail newsletters or bulletins you can opt-out 
			of receiving these communications by replying to the "unsubscribe" 
			address in the body of the email. In jurisdictions where sharing personal 
			information is prohibited without your "opt-in", no information 
			will be shared without your prior consent. <br/></p>
			<p><b><i>4.3 Third Parties</i></b></p>
			<p>In addition, easyTravel 
			may retain the services of outside contractors to provide services for 
			us (e.g. ship products, provide technical support, or handle order processing).</p>
			<p>If you elect to purchase 
			a software license through one of easyTravel' authorized online resellers, 
			your personal data will need to be shared between the easyTravel reseller 
			(as your vendor) and easyTravel (as the software manufacturer and licensor). 
			Furthermore, in order to manage purchases and license renewals by easyTravel 
			customers, easyTravel will need to share your personal information with 
			a billing system service provider. </p>
			<p>Such service provider 
			will process data of easyTravel' customers only on behalf of easyTravel. 
			(These examples are not exhaustive, and may change from time to time). <br/>
			
			</p>
			<p>We require that all such 
			contractors keep the personal information of our customers secure and 
			confidential. We have contractually bound third parties to such restrictions 
			and require that these contractors provide for appropriate technical 
			and organizational measures to secure the data, that they use personal 
			information only on behalf of easyTravel and that they do not share personal 
			information with others or use your personal information for their own 
			marketing purposes. <br/></p>
			<p><b><i>4.4 Legal Disclosures</i></b></p>
			<p>Please be advised that 
			in certain instances, it may be necessary for easyTravel to disclose 
			your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required 
			by applicable law. No personally identifiable information will be disclosed 
			to any law enforcement agency or governmental agency except in response 
			to (i) a subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court of competent 
			jurisdiction; or (ii) a legal process having the same consequence as 
			a court-issued request for information, in that easyTravel would be in 
			breach of local law were it to refuse to provide such information, and 
			it or its officers, executive or employees would be subject to liability 
			for failing to honor such legal process, or,</p>
			<p>Where such disclosure 
			is necessary for easyTravel to enforce its legal rights pursuant to the 
			laws of the jurisdiction from which such information was gathered. <br/>
			</p>
			<p><b>5. Security of 
			Personal Information</b></p>
			<p>We have taken appropriate 
			security measures, consistent with international information practices, 
			to protect your personal information. These measures include, on our 
			web sites and Internet-enabled technologies, administrative, technical, 
			physical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized 
			access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction. <br/>
			</p>
			<p><b>6. Collection and 
			Use of Non-Personal Information</b></p>
			
			<p>We collect certain aggregate 
			and non-personal information when users visit our web sites. Aggregate 
			and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable 
			visitor. It tells us information such as how many users visited our 
			sites and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn 
			how to best tailor our web sites to our visitors. We collect this information 
			either through "cookie" technology or with "web beacons".</p>
			<p>Additionally and through 
			our various tracking methods discussed above and using log files, we 
			may track domain names, IP addresses, and browser types from people 
			who visit our site. We use this information to track aggregate traffic 
			patterns throughout easyTravel' Web site. Such information is not correlated 
			with any personal information. <br/></p>
			<p><b>7. Links to 
			OTHER WEB SITES</b></p>
			<p>At the easyTravel Web 
			sites, there are a number of links to companies with whom we have a 
			relationship. </p>
			<p>easyTravel is not responsible 
			for the privacy practices of our business partners. We encourage you 
			to read their privacy statements, as they may differ from ours. <br/>
			</p>
			<p><b>8. AMENDMENTS AND 
			CHANGES</b></p>
			<p>In the event there is 
			a major change to easyTravel's privacy practices, a prominent notice 
			will be posted on our Web site. If the change involves the use of your 
			personally identifiable information, the notice will contain instructions 
			on how you can opt-out of such use. <br/></p>
